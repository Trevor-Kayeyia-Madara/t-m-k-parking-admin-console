# Admin Console (React)

![Admin Console Logo](admin_console_logo.png)

Admin Console is a web application built using React that serves as the administration panel for managing various aspects of the system. It provides an intuitive interface for administrators to manage users, access control, settings, and other administrative tasks.

## Features

- User Management: Administrators can view and manage user accounts, including creating, editing, and deleting user profiles.
- Access Control: Fine-grained access control allows administrators to assign different permissions and roles to users.
- Settings Management: Administrators can customize system settings and configurations.
- Dashboard: A comprehensive dashboard provides an overview of system metrics and key performance indicators.
- Activity Logs: The system maintains detailed logs of user actions and system events for auditing and troubleshooting.
